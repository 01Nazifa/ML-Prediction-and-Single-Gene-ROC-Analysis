# Machine Learning Prediction and Gene Expression Analysis
This repository contains code for Machine Learning (ML) prediction using various classifiers, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and Single Gene Expression Level ROC Analysis. These analyses were performed on python and R programming language.

## Machine Learning Prediction:
### Classifiers Used:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Random Forest (RF)
3. Logistic Regression (LR)
4. Gaussian Process Classifier
5. Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
7. Decision Tree
8. XGBoost

### Dataset Information:
Normalize CountMatrix data was used in this code. 

Execute the ML_Prediction.py notebook to run the ML prediction analysis.
Tune hyperparameters, experiment with different classifiers, and evaluate model performance.

## Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA):
### Method Used:
Blockwise method

### Run WGCNA:
Execute the WGCNA_Analysis.R script to perform the WGCNA analysis.
Adjust parameters as needed and interpret the results.

## Single Gene Expression Level ROC Analysis
### Method Used:
pROC package for ROC analysis

### Run Single Gene ROC Analysis:
Execute the Single_Gene_ROC_Analysis.R script to perform individual gene ROC analysis.
Visualize and interpret the ROC curves for selected genes.
